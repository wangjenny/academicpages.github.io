Intro
------
Hi everyone, my name is Jenny Wang and this is a website I am messing around in.

By day, I am a Software Team Lead and QA Engineer. I am responsible for the day to day running and coordination for the latest
prototype of Transparent Language. I manage the agile backlog of JIRA issues as a Scrum Master and coordinate between
Development, Product Management, and QA departments. On the side I write automated tests and review PRs for the development 
team. 

All this means is I deliver a satisfying language learning experience while ensure our products use the most cutting edge technology.

Potential Blog Post #1
## Topic: What is your dream job? or Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
I have a passion for efficiency. The thrill of being able to accomplish goals before deadlines gives me the greatest rush. A planner at heart, I find great enjoyment in breaking down seemingly unsurmountable problems into manageable increments. I would assume that's what lead to my interest in the field of technology. It allows my left brain to go wild; organize and prioritize my to do list to my heart's content. After all, all of lifes problems are just an app away from being solved. 
Being so data driven has helped me in many ways in my life. Math was always my favorite subject. I would always be the friend who had the detailed iternary for any upcoming trip, making sure we would be able to hit up every scenic location and still be on time to reservations at the restaruant we saw on instagram the other day. #foodie
At this stage of my life, I am interested in growing my analytical mindset to help solve real world problems. I would love to continue to travel and learn from other to help expand my perspective. I am actively exploring ways to strengthen my creativity with my [photography] (https://www.instagram.com/hello.jennyw/) This is me on my journey of self discovery and finding happiness.

<!--- #### What are my greatest weaknesses?
* Reserved
From experience I notice it takes time for me to get accustomed to new environments. I can come off as shy in the beginning, because I prefer develop an understanding of products and subject matter before I voice my opinions. 
* Inexperience with large companies
Having only worked in a sub-200 employee company, I do not have experience working on projects with large teams. Although by working in a smaller company, it has allowed me to step up for different responsibilities when additional help is needed and to work with people across multiple departments.

#### What are some of my proudest accomplishments?
Professionally, I am proud of how I've grown my project just myself to a team of four full time testers. The biggest challenge had to be switching my mindset from a follower to a leader. Given the opportunity, I choose to go above and beyond what was required. My predecssor set some basic responsbilities for the position. When I took over, I was able to build and expand upon those responsibilities which lead to sustained progress and doubling the bug resolution rate of my team. 

It was a wonderful experience getting to work closer with the Development, Dev Ops, and Product Management Teams. I learned a lot about what goes into the Software Life Cycle. It was great seeing the correlation between self taught material and actual real world practices. 

Outside of work, I am most proud of having attained my Scrum Master certification. Since I had taken on a new role with little guidance of industry standards, I took it upon myself to do research off hours and arm myself with strategies to tackle problems at work. Having been out of school for a few years some self study was a good break to my day to day life and refreshing to be able to go at my own pace outside of the 9-5 grind.

#### If you were an animal which one would you be?
A lot of people have commented that I remind them of a dog: strong, loyal, happy-go-lucky. I however just visited the Atlanta Aquarium and have to say my favorite animal on display was the egg yolk jellyfish. The serene nature of these gentle aquatic creatures resonated with me. Perhaps I was just hungry.
would love to insert image of jellyfish here
