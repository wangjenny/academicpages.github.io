Iteration Conference
====
Iteration: Shaping the Next Decade
At Harvard Business School, hosted by Tech Club
2/1/2020: http://www.techconferencehbs.com/about
Attended: BosWomen Event, Audible- Myself, Sunnia Ye, Niral Patel
Why changes does the next decade hold? How can we apply the lessons we learned from the past decade- technical, organizational, and social - to avoid making the same mistakes again?

### Keynote 1
---
Andrew Bosworth “Bos”. Facebook VP AR/VR
Talking points: Experience leading up to his involvement with Facebook, been with the company since early on and connecting with Mark Zuckerberg.
Talked about facing challenges of privacy, moderating hate speech.
Spoke about future of Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality: Oculus, Portal
Movement from mobile phones/computing/apps -> becoming immersed in tech.
Three areas of focus for the next decade:
 - Industry (use to specialized training)
 - Enterprise (B2B, working remotely, saving on travel)
 - Consumer (Play, building relationships)

Impression:
* Interesting to learn about this new “frontier” of technology. Since the speaker is from Facebook, had to emphasize the importance of building Relationships and Connecting People.
* As this new platform continues to develop and grow, the 3 prong entryway into market saturation is a neat point to think about. The growth of AR/VR is happening slowly but steadily.
* Point about privacy will be interesting to see how it unfolds. Since AR/VR deals so much with vision and what we see/allow cameras to see, will bring up a question about what becomes private as more and more visual cues become data points and analyzed for future applications. Will the trade off between allowing Portal to see and hear my “private, in home” life be worth the value of less friction during video calls/communicating.
* The lines between what is personal/real and fictitious becomes increasingly blurry.
* Adoption of these new tools and technology will also be interesting to follow. Mobile phone are so pervasive because of their ease of transportability. Will be interesting to see what consumers and businesses
are willing to sacrifice to enter this virtual space.

### Keynote 2
Dan Doctoroff, Sidewalk Labs (“Bet” within Alphabet portfolio)
Building Better Cities
Focusing on intersection between Municipality/“Urbanists” and “Technologist”
Toronto is a pilot city, for urban design and development plan
What does it mean to be a “smart” city
Improvements to building infrastructure, modular construction to increasing affordable housing
Promoting the growth of cities, as opposed to the decline.
Sustainability, being a place where people want to move too, transit organization
Investing in city growth (growing partnerships with various government organizations). Sidewalk labs will act as a service cities can call upon to improve their area

Impression:
* Would have been interesting to learn more about comparison of US/North American cities compared to International Cities (primarily Asia)
* Business model is still rather murky. Sounds along the lines of privatizing public funding.

### Keynote 3
Dan Chu: CPO of Waymo (another “Bet” with Alphabet)
Future of driverless transportation
Iteration: How itʼs shaped the company
Initially looking to create driverless vehicles intended to be constantly monitored by a driver -> after internal testing found this was not feasible
or desired by customer.
Intersection of Social Impact, Technology, and Smart Business Strategy
Focus on universal design and accessibility being a win for all customers
Currently pilot program running in Phoenix AZ

Impression:
* Iteration Speed is more important than Big Bangs (keep conducting proof of concepts as opposed to working towards a monolithic goal)
* Enable Customers instead of looking to disrupt
* Social Impact at core as opposed to as a side effect
Safety.
* Driver/Pedestrian safety. When dealing with lives on the line with such disruptive tech
* Implications on social impact. Is it realistic to think that the automotive truck drivers/Uber/Lyft/Taxis will be able to easily and smoothly transition in to the jobs created by this new sector?
* Interested to see how the role out of this technology occurs, since it will be gradual and whether the impact will be attractive and easily digestible by the public.

####Panel 1
Health and Life: Empowering Consumers with Their Own Data
Speakers: Melynda Barnes, MD (Ro), Aditya Khosla (PathAI), Julia Morton (Flatiron Health), Erin Trimble (23andMe)
Points:
* Privacy and importance of consent
* Allowing customers the option to delete their data
* Big push on letting customers opt in, with the focus to use the anonymized data for furthering research
* Most highly regulated industry
* See tech infiltrating in to the healthcare industry with tele-doctors and more personalized forms of care

Thoughts:
* Interesting to see how health is a difficult field for tech and ML to enter given the amount of regulation and the fear public feels about having their entire genomic footprint being touched by these various corporations
* See as growth in wearables continue, biomedical metrics become more easily tracked and available to the public
* Learned about Golden State Killer case, how with so much data weʼre only becoming better and better at analyzing it quickly.
* Ongoing lawsuit between Health Data Apiʼs and Private Consumer Tech industry. “Open APIs”

####Panel 2
Fin Tech: Fad or Future
Speakers: Shira Brettman Jaffe (Plaid), Bhaumik Kotecha (Square), Rishav Mukherji (Coinbase), Emi Yoshikawa (Ripple)

Points:
* Banking processes, bitcoin, card networks. In an industry with various levels of access and points of entry for new tech-finance focused companies.
* Driven by consumer demand. See Venmo/Cash appʼs rise in popularity because consumers are demanding their finances be increasingly better
integrated with technology.
* Markets exist for horizontal scaling and vertical scaling (Square: provides small and medium size vendors access to the card marketplace v. Toast, a
one stop shop designed exclusively for restaruant in mind.)
* Competition in the market is growing, seeing trends away from loans, paycheck advances, and payday loans, enabling lower economic status customers to have greater control over their money
* Concern of security: blockchain technology, speed

Thoughts:
* As financial tooling landscape changes, how sill consumers be able to keep up, As market saturation increases will the accessibility of these tools have an equal/fair impact across multiple socioeconomic classes
* Interesting to see these technologies work across MPs. Will make international currency possible?
* How will failures in these technologies impact customers. Financial data is also highly personalized. As our net worth and values become increasingly digitalized. Will a bug in a program have the possibility of wiping out a populationʼs net worth and ruin them?

####Panel 3
Future of Work
Speakers: Sarah Bernard (Greenhouse Software), Mila Krivoruchko (Zoom Video Communications), Javier Ponce Suarez (Atos), Tiffany Treacy (Microsoft)

Points:
* Remote/ distributed work. Changes how we work. No longer tied down to a single geographic location.
* Increases worker flexibility.
* Focus on increasing productivity tools.
* See a rise in hiring for niche skills, see increase in transparency across different occupations (Glassdoor, Indeed, LinkedIn). Skills required and
more chances for mobility within and across industry
* More data collected from the productivity tools, will make more specialized, personal reports to inform better workerʼs productivity.
* See a rise in gig economy. But also job automation.
* For hiring, since employees have more information at their fingertips than ever, company ethics are becoming more important.

Thoughts:
* With the rise in job automation, there will be a big shift in occupations which are growing. What will become of those in extinct industries. Will this increase the divide between those who have means and those who do not.
* With the shift towards specialized employee skill sets, wonder how thatʼll impact our existing eduction system.
* As hiring for certain occupations become more competitive, how much should a company be responsible for their employeeʼs happiness? How is the complete compensation package will entice the most skilled in their industry. (Shift to fewer working hours, commute subsidies, housing subsidies, etc)
* With increased flexibility comes less distinction between work life and personal life. How will society be impacted by employees who potentially always have work on their mind.

##Conference Notes
* Had strong impression from all the Keynote speakers. All the talks were well organized and captivating.
* Panels were more hit or miss, find it really depended on the moderatorʼs role.
* Having fireside chats is a good way of having specialists convey their expertise with a relatively large audience without the awkward silences that
usually come from a strictly audience Q&A panel.
* Conference itself had a more business minded focus.
* Choosing to cover a breath of topics as opposed to going in depth on one specific field.
* Definitely was helpful in providing a good baseline knowledge into a variety of fields in a short period of time.
* By the end of the day, was definitely drained. Had the conference gone on for much longer wouldnʼt to be able to synthesize and process additional
information
* Career fair was lacking (see the above note for more business minded focus)
* Had a conference specific app to download which was very helpful (even for a small conference). Could easily read up on the speakers, and organize my day. All conferences should come with an app. Especially one with a map (and highlight the restroom locations!)
* Got a chance to interact with Oculus Gear and play Beat Saber!
 - Thought it was funny the song they chose was PopStars by KDA.
 - Having the options to choose a headset with screens visible showing my gameplay and progress and a private headset, I chose the private one for fear of embarrassing myself in front of those waiting in line to play.
 - Controls were intuitive, and quite fun! Disorienting a bit to emerge from the headset and leave the virtual world to the conference space.
