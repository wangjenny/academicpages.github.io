This ain't easy.

Favicon Struggles
======

Holy moly, what a week it’s been. I’ve put a huge amount of time and dedication to get this site up and running. Much of which I attribute to  my inexperience of web development. It’s a fun and interesting process but boy does trying out different solutions just to implement the smallest of changes wear you out after a while.

So far my experience of getting the favicon to appear has been by far the most stressful. That tiny icon you see at the top of the tab? For 2 days it was the bane of my existence. As to why I felt so compelled to make that my enemy #1, perhaps from my years of QA testing, I took it as a personal offense finding the issue on MY site! 

After struggling with designs and stopping myself from falling down the rabbit hole of photoshop, I came up with this.

Sure was a lot of work for such a small picture.

### Biggest takeaways from my first website woes.
- *Design is hard*, who would have thought such a small image would be so hard to create
  - When working with such a small image, simplicity matters. Deciding what to remove is just as important as deciding what to add 
  - Got to make plans to learn photoshop
- Importance of knowing your problem: scope/keywords etc.
  - I search on multiple forums each with slightly different variations in answers, where to put files etc. Should have narrowed down search to my specific template. Prevents you from getting bogged down with information fatigue or overwhelmed with unknown terms.
- It’s *okay to start over*. After trying to Frankenstein a solution together out of 4 different suggestions I realized I was not understanding the root of the issue and throwing together everything would likely lead me to getting lost and further away from my goals. Luckily GitHub is not a scary forest but a version control service. I’m glad I was able to revert to a previous commit and start from a clean slate.
- *Tenacity*, moving outside of web development, process shows me the power I have to face any problem. The formula will always be the same. And I’m glad I was able to persevere even after all the times I got stuck

#### Important to celebrate the small successes though
